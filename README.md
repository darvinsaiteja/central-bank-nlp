# Central Bank Text Corpus

A text corpus of central bank communications. I hope it is useful. Please submit an issue if it is not. 

The New Zealand Central Bank corpus is in folders by year. The United States Central Bank Corpus is a list and not in folder by year. The reason for doing so is because I do not know the best way to structure a corpus.

"As you learn more apply this knowledge to the whole corpus and be prepared to make changes, including leaving out data you have gathered, if this improves the final corpus. Keep a detailed record of the data you collect." David Evans, University of Nottingham

### Natural Language Processing

The notebook Sentiment Analysis R is where I am learning how to do text mining in R with my central bank text data. 

#### Challenges

Scraping to download communications would be best to get the data. Right now I am copying the communications and putting them in text files. I need to explore more how I can use scraping to get quicker access to text data.

I am struggling to load all of the fomc text data so I can use more documents than one. Right now, I am cutting and pasting a text document and then doing analysis on it.
