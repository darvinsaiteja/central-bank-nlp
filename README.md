# Central Bank Text Corpus

A text corpus of central bank communications. I hope it is useful. Please submit an issue if it is not. 

The New Zealand Central Bank corpus is in folders by year. The United States Central Bank Corpus is a list and not in folder by year. The reason for doing so is because I do not know the best way to structure a corpus.
