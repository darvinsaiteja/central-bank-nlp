# Central Bank Text Corpus

A text corpus of central bank communications. I hope it is useful. Please submit an issue if it is not. 

The New Zealand Central Bank corpus is in folders by year. The United States Central Bank Corpus is a list and not in folder by year. The reason for doing so is because I do not know the best way to structure a corpus.

"As you learn more apply this knowledge to the whole corpus and be prepared to make changes, including leaving out data you have gathered, if this improves the final corpus. Keep a detailed record of the data you collect." David Evans, University of Nottingham
